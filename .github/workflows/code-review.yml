# Automated Code Review Workflow Using AI Assistants
# ============================================================================
# This workflow orchestrates multiple AI-powered code review tools to provide
# comprehensive automated code analysis on pull requests. It integrates:
# - Cursor Bot (AI code review)
# - Google Gemini AI (code analysis and suggestions)
# - GitHub Copilot CLI (code explanations)
# - Security scanning tools (Trivy, Semgrep, Bandit)
# - Dependency vulnerability scanning (Snyk, Dependency Review)
# - CodeRabbit AI (automated PR reviews)
# - CircleCI integration (external CI pipeline triggering)
# - Jules.MD (documentation review)
#
# The workflow runs on PR events and provides detailed feedback through
# GitHub comments and security alerts.
