# GitHub Issue Template Configuration
# ============================================================================
# This file configures GitHub issue templates and contact links for the
# repository. It controls which issue templates are available and provides
# links for security reporting and other contact methods.
#
# Configuration:
# - blank_issues_enabled: Set to false to require users to use issue templates
# - contact_links: Provides quick links for common issue types (security, etc.)
# ============================================================================

# Disable blank issues - users must use issue templates for better organization
# This ensures all issues have proper structure and required information
blank_issues_enabled: false

# Contact links for specialized issue reporting
# These appear as quick links when creating new issues
contact_links:
  # Security vulnerability reporting link
  # IMPORTANT: Replace OWNER/REPO with your actual GitHub username/repository
  # Example: https://github.com/yourusername/notebook/security/policy
  # GitHub will automatically replace OWNER/REPO with actual values if left as-is
